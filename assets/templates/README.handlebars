SVG Logos
====================
#### A collection of svg vector logos for developers.
[View All](http://svgporn.com)

The logos are optimized (removed duplicated paths / excessive groups / empty defs, linting, etc).
Some were recreated from rastered images.

## Tips for working with SVGs
• Always convert borders to paths. They use a fixed size and behave strangely when resized.  
• Join all the paths into one and use it as a background/mask. Or at least overlap your paths.

## Contributing
Since I optimize all the files manually I won't accept pull requests with new logos.
Please add your requests in the issues preferably with links to the vector files.  

*All logos appearing on the site are the property of their respective owners.*
